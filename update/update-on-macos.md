# Update on macOS

To update Bastion, first of all, you will need to navigate into the `Bastion` directory. _That is where the script is!_

```bash
cd ~/Bastion
```

Then, it is as simple as running this:

```bash
./bastion.sh --update
```

Wait for a few moments, so that it can update Bastion and its dependencies that you need to run Bastion smoothly. Meanwhile, you can go grab a cup of coffee \(or tea, if you prefer that\).

Once it is done, it will let you know.

Now, you can start Bastion, as usual, simply by running:

```text
./bastion.sh --start
```
