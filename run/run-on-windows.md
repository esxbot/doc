# Run on Windows

If you have successfully installed Bastion, you will have a `run.cmd` script that makes it easy to run Bastion without any hassle.

To start Bastion, first of all, you will need to navigate into the `Bastion` directory. _That is where the script is!_

Then, it is as simple as running running the `run.cmd` script by double-clicking \(or single-clicking, based on your settings\) it.
