# Install on Linux

## Downloading the installer

Downloading the installer is a fairly straight forward process:

```bash
wget https://raw.github.com/TheBastionBot/Bastion-Scripts/master/BastionInstaller.sh && chmod +x BastionInstaller.sh
```

This will download the installer into the current directory.

## Installing Bastion

To start the installation process, simply run the installer:

```bash
./BastionInstaller.sh
```

Wait for a few moments, so that it can download and install everything you will need to run Bastion smoothly. Meanwhile, you can go grab a cup of coffee \(or tea, if you prefer that\).

Once it is done, it will let you know.

{% hint style="info" %}
This will install Bastion into your `HOME` directory.
{% endhint %}

Now, you will have a directory named `Bastion,` in your `HOME` directory, where Bastion is installed.
